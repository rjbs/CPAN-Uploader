# ABSTRACT: upload things to the CPAN

=head1 ORIGIN

This code is mostly derived from C<cpan-upload-http> by Brad Fitzpatrick, which
in turn was based on C<cpan-upload> by Neil Bowers.  I (I<rjbs>) didn't want to
have to use a C<system> call to run either of those, so I refactored the code
into this module.

=method upload_file

  CPAN::Uploader->upload_file($file, \%arg);

  $uploader->upload_file($file);

Valid arguments are:

  user       - (required) your CPAN / PAUSE id
  password   - (required) your CPAN / PAUSE password
  subdir     - the directory (under your home directory) to upload to
  http_proxy - uri of the http proxy to use
  upload_uri - uri of the upload handler; usually the default (PAUSE) is right
  debug      - if set to true, spew lots more debugging output

This method attempts to actually upload the named file to the CPAN.  It will
raise an exception on error.

=method new

  my $uploader = CPAN::Uploader->new(\%arg);

This method returns a new uploader.  You probably don't need to worry about
this method.

Valid arguments are the same as those to C<upload_file>.

=cut

sub new {
  my ($class, $arg) = @_;

  $arg->{$_} or Carp::croak("missing $_ argument") for qw(user password);
  bless $arg => $class;
}

=method read_config_file

  my $config = CPAN::Uploader->read_config_file( $filename );

This reads the config file and returns a hashref of its contents that can be
used as configuration for CPAN::Uploader.

If no filename is given, it looks for F<.pause> in the user's home directory
(from the env var C<HOME>, or the current directory if C<HOME> isn't set).

See L<cpan-upload/CONFIGURATION> for the config format.

=cut

sub read_config_file {
  my ($class, $filename) = @_;

  unless (defined $filename) {
    my $home  = File::HomeDir->my_home || '.';
    $filename = File::Spec->catfile($home, '.pause');

    return {} unless -e $filename and -r _;
  }

  my %conf;
  if ( eval { require Config::Identity } ) {
    %conf = Config::Identity->load($filename);
    $conf{user} = delete $conf{username} unless $conf{user};
  }
  else { # Process .pause manually
    open my $pauserc, '<', $filename
      or die "can't open $filename for reading: $!";

    while (<$pauserc>) {
      chomp;
      if (/BEGIN PGP MESSAGE/ ) {
        Carp::croak "$filename seems to be encrypted. "
          . "Maybe you need to install Config::Identity?"
      }

      my ($k, $v) = /^\s*(\w+)\s+(.+)$/;
      Carp::croak "multiple enties for $k" if $conf{$k};
      $conf{$k} = $v;
    }
  }

  # minimum validation of arguments
  Carp::croak "Configured user has trailing whitespace"
    if defined $conf{user} && $conf{user} =~ /\s$/;
  Carp::croak "Configured user contains whitespace"
    if defined $conf{user} && $conf{user} =~ /\s/;

  return \%conf;
}

=method log

  $uploader->log($message);

This method logs the given string.  The default behavior is to print it to the
screen.  The message should not end in a newline, as one will be added as
needed.

=cut

sub log {
  shift;
  print "$_[0]\n"
}

=method log_debug

This method behaves like C<L</log>>, but only logs the message if the
CPAN::Uploader is in debug mode.

=cut

sub log_debug {
  my $self = shift;
  return unless $self->{debug};
  $self->log($_[0]);
}
